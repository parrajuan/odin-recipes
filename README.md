In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website to practice all the HTML knowledge acquired so far.
This includes:

- Set up my projectâ€™s GitHub repository
- Create the folder structure
- Create the recipe page content
- Commit all the changes using Git commands
- View the project on the web

** CSS Foundations Course
