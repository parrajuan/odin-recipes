The Odin Project - Foundations Course
Project: Recipes

In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website to practice all the HTML knowledge acquired so far.
This includes:

- Setting Up Your Projectâ€™s GitHub Repository
- Creating the folder structure
- Creating the Recipe Page content
- Commit all the changes using Git commands
- Viewing the Project on the Web
